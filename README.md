AI-Driven Video Summarizer using LaMini-Langchain and TVSum Dataset

Overview

This project implements an AI-driven video summarization system using LaMini-Langchain, a lightweight LangChain model optimized for summarization and natural language processing tasks. The system leverages the TVSum dataset, which contains annotated video importance scores, to generate concise yet informative video summaries.

Features

Automated Video Summarization: Extracts key moments from videos based on their importance.

LaMini-Langchain Integration: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques for content understanding.

TVSum Dataset Utilization: Uses ground truth importance scores for training and evaluation.

Customizable Summary Length: Allows users to control the level of summarization.

Efficient Processing: Optimized for performance and scalability.

Dataset: TVSum

The TVSum dataset (Title-Based Video Summarization) consists of 50 videos across various categories like news, travel, and sports. Each video has:

Annotated importance scores from multiple users.

Shot-level importance labels.

Metadata related to video content.




Model Pipeline

Video Preprocessing: Extracts frames and segments the video.

Feature Extraction: Uses LaMini-Langchain for NLP-based scene understanding.

Score Assignment: Assigns importance scores based on TVSum annotations.

Summary Generation: Selects and compiles key moments into a final summary.

Evaluation Metrics

F1-score: Measures alignment with TVSum ground truth.

Compression Ratio: Evaluates the effectiveness of summarization.

User Study: (Optional) Human evaluation of summary relevance.

Future Enhancements

Support for multi-modal summarization (audio + text + video).

Integration with real-time summarization pipelines.

Improvements in user interactivity (e.g., adjustable importance weights).
